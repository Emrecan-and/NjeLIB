# NjeLIB
I built daily reservation app for Library Center of  Neumann Janos Egyetem.Students can check to availability and they can book their place according to availability.

Usage Scenarios

For User

We have two person. One of them is user who name is Emrecan.One of them is admin who is librarian.So Emrecan wanted to book his place from library. He will register our application then he will login then he will check to availability from table of application.Then if it has place,Emrecan can book place by clicking book your place button.And also application greetings user according to time period.

For Admin

Librarian will login to application with admin account.Then librarian will see admin interface(not user interface).Application greetings librarian according to time period. Admin can change to capacity by entering value of capacity. Librarian must approve enterence and exit of students who got reservation by scanning QR code. At the end of day if someone forgot to scan his/her reservation,librarian can reset manually by clilcking reset button.
